## Introduction
This is a project for collecting my own small chisel designs. Most of them should eventually be upstream to chipsalliance/chisel.

## Pending PRs
This repository always tracks remote developing branches, it may need some patches to work, `make patch` will append below in sequence:
<!-- BEGIN-PATCH -->
chisel https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel/pull/3045.diff
